so tell me how i'm supposed to feel when the president spoke 
knowing he aint ever had to struggle he aint ever been broke
aint even rode through the ghetto he aint ever been close
trusting this government is like trusting the devil in oath
a rebel with quotes i get up.
lifestyles of the young black and reckless
a generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions 
like tell me why i aint got shit
i let this liquor fill my liver with them toxics as i sip.
